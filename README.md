# TODO

- Would a [compiler plugin](https://www.baeldung.com/java-build-compiler-plugin) be able to create functionality similar to the ? operator in rust?
- Forbid nullability in Tuples
- Change the unwrapping Exceptions to RuntimeExceptions as they should kill the program because the programmer 'knows what they are doing'.
- Look into code-generation of compile time checked builders (like in rust)
  - N Generics for N fields in class
  - Generics are either constructed or not
  - a construct method can only be called when all generics are constructed (this probably needs a big list of static methods)
